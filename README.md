## Background: Equity in Healthcare

Women in Data Science (WiDS) Worldwide is on a mission to increase participation of women in data science to benefit societies worldwide.

Healthcare inequity is a global challenge. Addressing this challenge has an extensive positive impact on women’s health, which is key for societies and economies to thrive. This datathon is designed to help you discover whether disparate treatments exist and to understand the drivers of those biases, such as demographic and societal factors.

## Overview: The Dataset and Challenge

Gilead Sciences is the sponsor for this year’s WiDS Datathon. They provided a rich, real-world dataset which contains information about demographics, diagnosis and treatment options, and insurance provided about patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer from 2015-2018. The dataset originated from Health Verity, one of the largest healthcare data ecosystems in the US. It was enriched with third party geo-demographic data to provide views into the socio economic aspects that may contribute to health equity. For this challenge, the dataset was then further enriched with zip code level toxicology data NASA/Columbia University.

## Challenge task:

You will be asked to predict if the patients received metastatic cancer diagnosis within 90 days of screening.

## Why is this important?

Metastatic TNBC is considered the most aggressive TNBC and requires most urgent and timely treatment. Unnecessary delays in diagnosis and subsequent treatment can have devastating effects in these difficult cancers. Differences in the wait time to get treatment is a good proxy for disparities in healthcare access.

The primary goal of building these models is to detect relationships between demographics of the patient with the likelihood of getting timely treatment. The secondary goal is to see if environmental hazards impact proper diagnosis and treatment.
